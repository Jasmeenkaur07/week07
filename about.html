      <p>Cancer is a broad term. It describes the disease that results when cellular changes cause the uncontrolled growth and division of cells.

        Some types of cancer cause rapid cell growth, while others cause cells to grow and divide at a slower rate.
        
        Certain forms of cancer result in visible growths called tumors, while others, such as leukemia, do not.
        
        Most of the bodyâ€™s cells have specific functions and fixed lifespans. While it may sound like a bad thing, cell death is part of a natural and beneficial phenomenon called apoptosis.
        
        A cell receives instructions to die so that the body can replace it with a newer cell that functions better. Cancerous cells lack the components that instruct them to stop dividing and to die.
        
        As a result, they build up in the body, using oxygen and nutrients that would usually nourish other cells. Cancerous cells can form tumors, impair the immune system and cause other changes that prevent the body from functioning regularly.
        
        Cancerous cells may appear in one area, then spread via the lymph nodes. These are clusters of immune cells located throughout the body.</p>
