        <h3>Jewelry Gemstones</h3>
        <p>A huge variety of minerals - 200 or more - have been used as gemstones at one time or another. But not all of these are suitable as jewelry gemstones, since many are too soft, too brittle or are too easily damaged by environmental factors. Some gemstones are best reserved for collectors rather than jewelry.

            Jewelry gemstones have varying requirements depending on the type of jewelry. Gemstones set in rings get the hardest wear, since they often come into contact with hard surfaces. Gems set in earrings are less likely to be subjected to daily wear and tear, and the same is true for pendants.</p>
